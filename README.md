# ExpressJs-Note-Taker
We were tasked to create an application that helps with taking notes, ie Note Taker. It is meant to write and save notes, we use Express.js for the back end to save and retreive note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
